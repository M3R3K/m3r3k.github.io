<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey there, my name is Kerem and I'm currently a computer engineering
    student in
    <em>Turkey</em>. This
    blog is my personal space
    where I talk about the things I learn along the way which are mainly about technology and philosophy.
</p>
<p>When I started reading Asimov's Foundation series, I was hooked. Later on I started to read Popular Science to pass
    time which has helped tremendously towards my general knowledge. Reading about what the future holds is my way of
    abstracting myself from the real world which I think is an important activity to enhance my creativity.</p>

<p>
    I like reading anthropology books because learning about human development makes me realize how far as a
    species have we evolved and continue to evolve through historical and natural events. For my understanding, this
    kind of perspective is important even when we're dealing with day to day issues, when you need to evaluate what the
    situation is and its significance in your life.
</p>


<p class="mb-5">This aforementioned perspective has helped me growing up and I would
    like to share that on my personal blog, although this blog probably won't be read by a lot of people I do think it
    is a great
    retrospective for me to look back and see my progress.</p>
