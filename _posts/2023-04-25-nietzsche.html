<p>Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was born on October 15, 1844, to a middle-class family with his father being the Lutheran
    Minister in the village of Röcken, close to Leipzig. His father and his brother died when he was only 5 years old
    and was the only male in his household. Shortly after these losses, the family moved to an urban neighborhood in
    Naumburg, Saxony.
    In his early teens, he joined the prestigious Christian school called Schulpforta where he received education in
    Theology, Humanities. While studying he left a good impression on his teachers.</p>

<p> In 1864 he entered the University of Bonn and shortly after his entry, he focused his academic life on Philology
    where he wanted to study classical languages. His contribution and curiosity towards ancient texts (mainly ancient
    Greek) drew the attention of Professor Ritschl and he was praised highly of him during that period. With all the
    praise he became semi-famous in the academic scene. He, later on, entered the University of Basel in Switzerland and
    became the Professor of Greek Language and Literature just at 24 years old.

<p>But he quickly lost interest in becoming an academician and later on moved to Sils Maria on the outskirts of the
    Swiss Alps and lived relatively peacefully while working on his sensational philosophic ideas. He published The
    Birth of Tragedy, Human All to Human, The Gay Science, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, and many more where he talked in
    great depth about his philosophy.
    At that point in his life, he was having difficulties with his family, was failing relationships with women and his
    books weren't selling as expected. And when he was mid 40's he had a mental breakdown and when he was trailing on
    the street he saw a horse getting beaten by its driver and quickly embraced the horse shouting "I understand you".
    Nietzsche never recovered from that breakdown.</p>

<span class="caption">Nietzsche never really recovered from his mental breakdown.</span>

<p>Despite being depressed and having constant breakdowns, Nietzsche's philosophy was full of heroism and
    self-improvement. His ideal type of human was called an ÜBERMENSCH(superman) who overcomes difficulties and accepts
    what life throws at them. His work emphasized on getting people to become who they are in life. In order to achieve
    that, we need to implement 4 main recommendations.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Four main recommendations of Nietzsche</h2>

<p>The first one of the recommendations is owning up to envy whereas major Abrahamic religions teach envy as something
    to be feel ashamed of and it is associated with evil. However, to Nietzsche, being envious as long as we utilize it
    to make our life better than today. Every person should be seen as a goal rather than a pure object that makes us
    jealous. People who cross the boundaries of success are hinting us who we might become one day. This approach
    basically tells us that we should face up our true desires and resist them and only then if we encounter failure we
    should mourn it. Übermensch utilizes that principle in his/her life.</p>

    )</span>

<p>His second recommendation was "Don't be a Christian". In Abrahamic religions, envy is associated with evil and
    emerged from the mindset of timid slaves that lacked the courage to get what they wanted. Those wanted entities
    could be money, fame, power, and women. Being a Christian, one was always clung to a philosophy that embraces
    cowardice. This was called slave morality in Nietzsche's terms. Religious people deemed these values as evil and
    embraced a hypocritical ideology and condemned what they always wanted. So in other words, sexlessness, and poverty
    became some sort of purity and goodness. Therefore Christianity is a giant cage for people who are in resentful
    denial.</p>

<span class="caption">To Nietzsche being a christian is accepting a hypocritical creed.</span>

<p>The third one on the list is "Never drink alcohol." Nietzsche himself was quite an interesting man as he only drank
    water. He makes the argument that narcotic substances and mind-numbing ideologies are the most dangerous to modern
    civilizations as it impedes the thinking process and numb people physiologically and mentally. Nietzsche hated the
    idea of numbing pain and reassurance of ideas at the expense of facing the truths and changing our lives for the
    better. As you can tell by these recommendations, he was an anti-conformist from the heart. As he calls it "The
    secret of a fulfilled life is: live dangerously."</p>

    class="img-fluid">
<span class="caption">"Taking action and facing problems head-on is the correct approach to life."</span>


<p>The last recommendation is "God is dead". His statement is not some sort of a celebration call, and the decrease in
    belief in higher order is not anything to cheer about. He understood that religion is false however, he also
    acknowledged that the belief helps us cope with the distress of life.
    This kind of deterioration of belief should be replaced by culture and fine arts in the form of art, music etc. For
    Nietzsche, philosophers should be on the fore front in handling great developments in social life and guide people
    when transitioning from old to the new age.</p>
