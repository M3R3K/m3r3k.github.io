<p>In mathematics, one of the most beautiful visual representations in my opinion is Mendelbrot set. To appreciate its
    beauty, one doesn't have to be a mathematician or from a similar background. However I think it is better to
    understand how we achieve this fractal pattern because it will show us that this pattern is not something
    human-made, but is a natural phenomenon. Next paragraph will explain the mathematics behind this set.</p>

<p>Firstly we will set our iterative function and set an initial real number.Our iterative function is as
    follows:<br>
</p>
<span style="margin: 0 35% 0 35%;"><em>f(z)
        = zÂ² +c</em></span>

<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the
    earth.</p>

<p>Let's say we chose 2 and the iterative values are: <br>
    1st: 6<br>
    2nd: 38 <br>
    3rd: 1446 <br>
    4th: 2090918 <br>
    ......</p>

<p>This value gets really big as we iterate on and on again, this means the value diverges over time. However the
    strange thing happens when we pick any value between -2 and 0.25 (inclusive), to show that let's say we pick 0.21 as
    an initial c value:</p>


<p>1st: 0.2541 <br>
    2nd: 0.27456681 <br>
    3rd: 0.2853869331535761 <br>
    4th: 0.2914457016148037 <br>
    5th: 0.2949405969897452 <br>
    ...</p>

<p>As you can tell by this example, this iteration is stabilizing around 0.29 and nearly never change around a
    significant iteration later. In mathematics this is called converging. This interval of numbers that are converging
    is called Mandelbrot set.</p>



<p>This can be shown in a simple graph:</p>

<p>As you can see there is nothing too interesting about that graph. However, when we add another dimension to this
    graph in the form of complex numbers, the graph will have the following shape where the behaviour of the iteration
    can be bounded which means the value will stay within a distance from the point zero but will not converge, it can
    converge or can diverge.</p>

<h6 class="section-heading">Here is the example code written in Java:</h6>

<pre class="line-numbers">
    <code class="language-java">
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            double number =0.21;
            double initial =number;
            int i=0;
            while(i<8) {
                i++;
                number = number* number +initial;
                System.out.println(number);
            }
        }
    </code>
