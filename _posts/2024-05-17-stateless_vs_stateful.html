<p>In Flutter, stateless and stateful widgets are two fundamental types of widgets that define how a UI component
    behaves and interacts with the application state. It is important to differentiate between them as it is a concept
    used every time a developer tries to create a new widget</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Stateless Widgets</h2>
<p>A StatelessWidget is immutable, meaning it cannot change its state after being created. It is designed for widgets
    whose configuration and appearance remain constant throughout their lifecycle.</p>
<h4>Characteristic properties of Stateless Widgets</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Immutable: Once created, the widget cannot change.
    </li>
    <li>
        Lightweight: Suitable for UI elements that do not need to update or interact dynamically.
    </li>
    <li>Rebuild Mechanism: When the widget tree is rebuilt (e.g., due to a parent widget's state change), a new instance
        of the StatelessWidget is created.</li>
</ul>
<p> Stateless widgets are typically used in Static text or images, icons and layout containers such as Row, Column or
    Containers. Example code given below:</p>

<div class="container">
    <div class="code-wrapper">
        <pre>
                 <button id="copy-button">Copy</button>
                  <code id="code" class="language-dart">class MyStatelessWidget extends StatelessWidget {
final String title;
                  
MyStatelessWidget({required this.title});
                  
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Displays the title passed during creation
    return Text(title); 
    }
}
                  </code>
</div>

<p>In this example, MyStatelessWidget simply displays the title. You can't update the title after the widget is created.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Stateful Widgets</h2>
<p>A StatefulWidget is dynamic and can change during its 
    lifecycle based on user interaction, data updates, or other events. It consists of two classes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>StatefulWidget Class</em>: Represents the widget itself.</li>
    <li><em>State Class:</em> Maintains the state of the widget and contains logic to update the UI.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Characteristic properties of Stateful Widgets</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Dynamic State: Can update or modify the UI in response to events.</li>
    <li>State Management: The State class stores properties that change and provides methods like setState to trigger updates.</li>
    <li>Lifecycle Methods: Includes methods such as initState, setState, and dispose to manage the widget's lifecycle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stateful Widgets are typically used in Form inputs, 
    Buttons with toggling states, Animations or timers or generally 
    Widgets that respond to asynchronous data(Such as API calls).</p>



    <div class="container">
        <div class="code-wrapper">
            <pre>
                     <button id="copy-button">Copy</button>
                      <code id="code" class="language-dart">class MyStatefulWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyStatefulWidgetState createState() => _MyStatefulWidgetState();
}

class _MyStatefulWidgetState extends State<MyStatefulWidget> {
  int counter = 0;

  void incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      counter++; // Updates the counter and refreshes the UI
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Counter: $counter'),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: incrementCounter,
          child: Text('Increment'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
                      </code>
    </div>

<p>In this example, pressing the button updates the counter state, 
    which triggers a UI rebuild to reflect the new value. 
    This is also the default code when building a new project in flutter.</p>

<h4>Choosing Between Stateless and Stateful Widgets</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Use <b>StatelessWidget</b> when the widget does not need to change after being created.</li>
    <li>Use <b>StatefulWidget</b> when the widget needs to respond to user input, animations or data updates dynamically.</li>

</ul>

<p>Understanding the difference between Stateless and Stateless Widget is crucial as it affects the design of the whole application!</p>
