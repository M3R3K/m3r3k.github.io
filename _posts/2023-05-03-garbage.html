<p>In a typical program that runs code and dynamically allocates the part of your memory on your hardware, it's mostly
    unknown how much memory you will use concurrently. This program can be anything from a website that you load up on
    your browser to a game that you play on lazy Saturday nights. So the implementation of garbage collection basically
    does is, it constantly searches and detects a memory that is not referenced(used) but allocated for the program and
    when it detects the aforementioned memory, it releases it so other processes can use that bit of space to run
    smoothly and makes it possible to multitask on modern computers.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Manual memory management</h2>
<p>Typically in older programming languages for example, in C language you manually get a memory space with certain
    functions. So to get a memory of a certain quantity, you have to type how many bytes you want to allocate and free
    that memory space once you're done using it. To give an example of this, here is an example code written in C:
</p>

<div class="container">
    <p class="language" id="language-copy">C</p>
    <div class="code-wrapper">
        <pre>
            <button id="copy-button">Copy</button>
            <code id="code" class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int main() {
    int *ptr;
    int n = 5;
    ptr = (int*) malloc(n * sizeof(int)); // allocate memory for 5 integers
    if (ptr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed");
        exit(1); // exit the program with an error code
    }
    // assign values to the memory block
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        *(ptr + i) = i;
    }
    // print the values from the memory block
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", *(ptr + i));
    }
    free(ptr); // free the allocated memory
    return 0;
}     
            </code>
        </pre>
    </div>

<p>The Malloc function takes one argument, which is the amount of memory to allocate in bytes. It then returns a pointer
    to the allocated block of memory. In the case of allocation, the operation is not successful, the function returns a
    NULL pointer. Here in the given code we've allocated 5 integer amounts of bytes to ptr and assigned values to them.
    Then finally we freed the allocated memory using the free function. Freeing existing memory at the last step is
    really important in order to prevent memory leaks. The common error people make when building large-scale codebases
    on these languages is that when at any point of the program, the allocated memory is not freed, the computer won't
    take it back because it is flagged as being used by that program. The other common mistake is when you freed the
    memory and you try to access that same bit of memory, in that case, the OS might have given that block to some other
    process and because of that, you might get compile-time errors or some random value you didn't ask for.</p>

<p>In this approach, as we have seen from the examples, we might encounter loads of problems. So in order to get ahead
    of that, most high-level programming languages have some sort of garbage collection built in. In short, garbage
    collection basically gives you memory when you don't need it anymore.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Ways of garbage collection</h2>

<p>The most obvious way of garbage collection is reference counting. In this method, the allocated memory has a property
    called reference counter, you keep track of how many references that bit of memory has, and you free the
    aforementioned memory when it finally has zero references in the program. This approach has its own tradeoffs,
    firstly you have to remember to add or decrease this property and the other one is that with this approach you now
    have an integer associated with all of the memory spaces in your program which makes the program memory inefficient
    and can decrease the program's performance. Another problem is some sort of memory leak where you have some memory
    blocks with reference counter that doesn't go zero in order to free them. This in itself can be classified as a
    memory leak. With its tradeoffs, the reference counting is used in programming languages like Python where it's used
    with other sound methods of garbage collection like mark and sweep algorithm.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Mark and sweep</h2>
<p>To understand the mark and sweep algorithm we need to know about live memory and dead memory concepts. Live memory is
    a memory block that is actively referenced, whereas dead memory is a memory block that doesn't have any references
    to it.</p>
<img src="/img/posts/garbage/garbage1.jpg" class="img-fluid">
<span class="caption">In this example, x and y is referencing memory blocks 1 and 2 so they are live memory and
    therefore marked.</span>
<p>Mark stage goes through all of the accessible memory blocks, even the blocks that are not directly referenced. Here
    in this example if we remove the y reference to the memory block 2:</p>
<img src="/img/posts/garbage/garbage2.jpg" class="img-fluid">
<p>Marking goes through all the direct or indirect references marks them one by one sort of like a boolean value,
    because of that the program size is lower than the reference count method.</p>

<p>Sweeping stage frees up the unmarked memory block, making our program less dependent on high chunks of memory.
