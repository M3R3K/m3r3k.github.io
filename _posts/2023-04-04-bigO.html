<p>One of the fundamental building concepts of Computer Science is big O notation. Students may learn this concept in
    their data structures and algorithms course because, in basic terms, big O notation is used to describe the
    efficiency of a certain algorithm. This type of approach lets us compare different algorithms and lets us decide
    whether or not we should implement that algorithm given its size and function.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The role of big O notation in data structures and algorithms</h2>
<p>To type out this notation shortly, when we want to show the runtime complexity of a linear search algorithm it is
    simply: " <em>O(n)</em> "<br>
    This means that the time increases linearly as the number of elements increases. This deduction has been made by
    considering the worst possible scenario in a given algorithm. The runtime of let's say a sorting algorithm can be as
    little as one(instant), however, this is not guaranteed and therefore is not taken into account when we talk about
    big O notation. Here are the different algorithms with their big O notations and their relative positions on a
    linear graph.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">As the graph shows, we can deduct whether an algorithm is efficient and its feasibility
    before implementing it.</span>

<h2 class="section-heading">Combining algorithms and for loops</h2>
<p>When combining different big O values, we must follow these mathematical rules. Firstly, let us imagine two
    functions, namely f, and g which have their own runtime complexity.<br>
    If we want to combine these two algorithms and
    deduct the big O notation of the combined algorithm, we would get: <em>O(f(n) + g(n))</em> <br>
    Consequently, when we iterate over a set of elements or arrays, we get the size of the element as n where n is the
    number of elements( infinitely large) in the loop. The complexity can be expanded when we put the same size loop
    inside a loop where at that point, the big O notation expands exponentially.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">How code slows as data grows</h2>
<p>To conclude this post, big O notation is an essential tool when it comes to scalability, where the feasibility of
    certain approaches is decided by programmers. It is certainly a great tool for anyone working with the new emerging
    technologies in IT, namely Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.</p>
